  Avid lore character starts his way in the "100 Days in a Minecraft Nightmare" series,
  <a href="https://youtu.be/szGFe0vgsGI?t=93">where he finds a village and names it "New Salem"</a>.
  Avid proclaimed himself the protector of this village.
  <a href="https://youtu.be/szGFe0vgsGI?t=75">He also named an iron golem Jeremy</a>,
  who helped protect the village from blood moons and had a special place in Avid's heart.
  <a href="https://youtu.be/szGFe0vgsGI?t=1191">Jeremy later dies during a blood moon</a>. RIP Jeremy.
  <a href="https://youtu.be/szGFe0vgsGI?t=1290">
    After that horrible blood moon Avid performs a "ritual" described in
    a book found in an abandoned altar and starts serving the Dark Lord
  </a>.

    He starts hearing a voice in his head, which guides him. At one point, voice suggests going to
    the nether. He does, and instead of nether, ends up in Incendium, where we see Olm, The Old One for the first time.
    It was his voice in Avid's head.
  </a>
  Olm destroys the portal back and forces Avid to travel across Incendium and find his sanctum.
  He does and after a final fight Olm reveals himself.
  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dOLxIq2emM?t=942">
    Olm suggests that blood moons were happening because of the Dark Lord, whose real name is Demon of Darkness.
    He tells Avid to defeat it, after which New Salem will be safe. But it comes at a cost of being sent to a place
    far away, from where there is no return.
  </a>
  Avid comes back to New Salem and as the final goodbye
  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dOLxIq2emM?t=1304">he builds The statue of Jeremy</a>.
  He defeats the "Demon of Darkness" and
  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dOLxIq2emM?t=1442s">is sent to Limbo with no faith of returning.</a>

  <a href="https://youtu.be/mcfRVIzNq8c?t=320s">Spent 1000 years in limbo,
  Avid agrees to a deal with Olm to send a piece of his soul out of limbo,
  into the land of pure void, hoping that if he completes Olm's job he could get home.</a>
  <i>STILL looking for explanation of
    <a href="https://youtu.be/mcfRVIzNq8c?t=497s">this</a>
    second, but looks like this is how Marm found out about the way Avid was sent to SBK1</i>
