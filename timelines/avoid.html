  While Skyvid is in SBK1, majority of his soul (named as Avoid by the community) is still stuck in limbo as an always sad dusk.

  <a href="https://youtu.be/sam-a4NCUbQ?t=1754">Skyvid and Marm figured out how to get dusk Avid out of limbo through Leon's wafflehouse (which
  Leon and Olm can manifest when they choose)</a>. Upon entering the wafflehouse, Avoid sees Leon in his terrible enderman curse and Olm.
  Olm agrees to "free" Avoid from Limbo, mentioning he originally was going to send him into the abyss for 10,000 years. Olm wants Avoid to
  be an architect for the universe he is sculpting. He also transfers Leon's enderman curse to Avoid. After sending him to the new universe,
  he won't remember a thing.
