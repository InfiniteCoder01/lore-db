  Skyvid arrives in SBK1

  <i>Looking for explanation of
    <a href="https://youtu.be/mcfRVIzNq8c?t=249">this</a>
    second, but looks like this is how Marm found out about the way Avid was sent to SBK1</i>

  <a href="https://youtu.be/6D3ThbTSULM?t=1674">He falls into the void in the first EP and lights up limbo on fire (?)</a>.
  He talks to Olm, gets transformed into a monkey and is sent back.

  <a href="https://youtu.be/sam-a4NCUbQ?t=1754">Monkey Avid and Marmalade figured out how to get dusk Avid out of limbo through Leon's wafflehouse</a>.
He got transported into AA world and also got the enderman curse from Leon.
</event>
<event>
In the AA world he slowly frees from the enderman curse & dusk discoloration somehow (running quests as a good guy?)
</event>
<event>
Marmalade visits avid in AA with void magic (shown in I Built a MEGA Island on Marm's channel + in Avid's AA video), and by the end of SBK1 she transports them both to AA world, where Avid would hide to this day (prooven by his comment).
